```javascript
//Example using Tailwind's hover pseudo-class
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Hover to change color
</button>
```

This button will change background color on hover.  However, if you have conflicting styles or improper class order, the hover state might not apply correctly.  For example, a parent element's style might unintentionally override the hover effect.

```javascript
<!-- Solution: Ensuring correct specificity -->
<div class="relative">
  <button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded absolute inset-0">
    Hover to change color
  </button>
</div>

<!-- OR -->

<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded hover:bg-blue-700 !important">
  Hover to change color
</button>
```

The solution demonstrates two approaches:

1. **Using `!important`:**  This is generally discouraged for maintainability, but in some cases it's a quick fix.  This forces the hover state to take precedence.  However, this should be used sparingly, otherwise it can cause issues in other parts of the code.
2. **Better specificity:**  This involves restructuring the HTML or using more specific selectors to ensure the hover state has higher specificity than conflicting styles.
